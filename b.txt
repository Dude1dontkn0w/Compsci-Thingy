<p> 
We're no strangers to love <br>
You know the rules and so do I <br>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of <br>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy <br>

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling <br>
Gotta make you understand <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>

We've known each other for so long <br>
Your heart's been aching, but <br>
You're too shy to say it <br>
Inside, we both know what's been going on <br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it <br>

And if you ask me how I'm feeling <br>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>

(Ooh, give you up) <br>
(Ooh, give you up) <br>
Never gonna give, never gonna give <br>
(Give you up) <br>
Never gonna give, never gonna give <br>
(Give you up) <br>

We've known each other for so long <br>
Your heart's been aching, but <br>
You're too shy to say it <br>
Inside, we both know what's been going on <br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it <br>

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling <br>
Gotta make you understand <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>

Never gonna give you up <br>
Never gonna let you down <br>
Never gonna run around and desert you <br>
Never gonna make you cry <br>
Never gonna say goodbye <br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <br>
