<p> 
Do you really matter at all? <br>
Maybe we need to find out why is that <br>
So that we could quest and go stall <br>
Looking for the answer, out in the world we cant recall <br>
 <br>
Do things really happen in balance? <br>
What about the things that happened no one solved, <br>
Trapped in eternal imbalance <br>
Still no answer, what if we couldn't find one? <br>
 <br>
Standards set at high disregard, <br>
No one can achieve <br>
No matter how one works hard into the night <br>
We really can’t, there is no purpose other than hard. <br>
 <br>
Things never change, how hard you adapt <br>
Why it happens, no one can draft <br>
The only thing that one can do in these times of need <br>
Is to help others that are around in wake up from their sleep. <br>
What if I couldn’t even try to help them get up? <br>
All hope is lost, the end is near, we have already given up <br>
 <br>
Why will no one ever see me? <br>
maybe, im just a shadow working at the seems <br>
Finding my purpose under the moon <br>
What if no one finds me? <br>
When I stray out too far from thee <br>
 <br>
Will I be able to survive? <br>
After all these problems <br>
And the too-high stuff I strive, <br>
Maybe I shouldn’t but I do <br>
I cannot really stop, <br>
“As the potential is in me.” <br>
 <br>
Forever alone, always striving for the impossible <br>
Never waking up from doing all of these impossibles <br>
Still in there, soundly sleeping <br>
Waiting for the banging ending <br>
Doing whatever I can with materials at the seams <br>
